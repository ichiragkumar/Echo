# Progress Report

## Done

*   Verified that `packages/extension/manifest.json` correctly points to `.svg` icon files.
*   Verified that the `.svg` icon files exist in `packages/extension/assets`.
*   Analyzed the extension's code (`popup.js`, `service-worker.js`, `content-script.js`) to understand its functionality.
*   Confirmed that the `server.js` file provides the necessary WebSocket server for the extension.
*   Identified the correct command (`npm run dev`) to start the server.

## To Do

*   Guide the user on how to run the server and test the extension.
*   Confirm with the user that reloading the extension in the browser resolves the icon error.
*   Assist with any further steps for testing the extension.
